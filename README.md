Napkin AI is an amazing tool that helps you turn your ideas into stunning visuals in just a few steps. After trying this tool, your presentations will never be the same again!

### Getting Started
To get started, visit [napkin.ai](https://www.napkin.ai) and click on “Get Napkin Free.” On the next page, you'll have an option to sign up/sign in using your Google account or email.

### Generating Visuals/Diagrams
To generate your visuals or diagrams, you can either prompt Napkin AI to generate descriptions for you or, if you already have the text you want to use, you can paste it directly.

### Examples

#### Example 1: The Journey of a Customer in E-commerce
1. Once the text is generated, select all the steps mentioned and click “Generate Visual.”
2. This generates the diagram and gives you the option to customize it.

#### Example 2: Process of Big Data Analytics
1. Similar to the previous example, once you have generated a diagram, you can modify it as needed.

### Customization & Download
Once you've generated a diagram that you like, you can download it in various formats as shown below.

You can also make edits to your diagram to fit your needs or add more details/customizations.

### Sharing
You can share your work by generating a link or downloading a PDF version of your document. To do this, click the “Share” button at the top right corner of the page.

### Issues on Mobile
Napkin AI might not work well on mobile devices. If you don’t have access to a computer to try this out, we recommend checking out tools like Graphicinfo, Graphy, or other similar services that serve the intended purpose. A quick Google search should provide you with more options. While these tools may not produce the same result, you should still try them and submit your output if mobile is your only option.
